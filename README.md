The group project will constitute 2 (or 3) tasks. The total points for the group project is divided equally
among all tasks. You will work with your team-mates on all tasks. Each group would need to prepare one
HTML or PDF file for each task that contains both the codes and the descriptions of how you have completed
the task. Please be succinct when explaining what you have done. Your codes should be self-explanatory
and require minimum comments; for example, avoid sentences such as “in this line I am separating the data
points into groups using the . . . function”. You should, however, provide justifications for the decisions that
you make (for example, coming up with costs for each types of error).
